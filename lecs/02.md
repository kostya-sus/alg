----------
**LRU cache**
There is a small fast memory (the “cache”) and a big slow memory. For example, the former could be an on-chip cache and the latter main memory; or the former could be main memory and the latter a disk. There is a program that periodically issues read and write requests to data stored on “pages” in the big slow memory. In the happy event that the requested page is also in the cache, then it can be accessed directly. If not — on a “page fault” a.k.a. “cache miss” — the requested page needs to be brought into the cache, and this requires evicting an incumbent page. The key algorithmic question is then: which page should be evicted?

You should have learned in your systems classes that the LRU policy kicks butt in practice, and is certainly much better than the FIFO policy. Indeed, cache policy designers generally adopt LRU as the \gold standard" and strive to simulate it using minimal resources, since keeping track of the most recent request to every page in the cache can be too expensive. There is strong intuition for LRU's superior empirical performance: request sequences generally possess locality of reference, meaning that a page requested recently is likely to be requested again soon. (Just think of a program's code; if you just executed a given line and are in a loop, you'll probably execute it again shortly.)


**Dynamic Programming (DP)**
> -  Powerful algorithmic design technique
> -  Large class of seemingly exponential problems have a polynomial solution (“only”)
via DP
> - Particularly for optimization problems (min / max)

Fibonacci Numbers : F1 = F2 = 1; Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2.
Goal: compute Fn
