1) Given a string S and a dictionary of words DICT, add spaces in S to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences. For example, given S = "catsanddog", DICT = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"], the solution is ["cats and dog", "cat sand dog"].

2) A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Longest common subsequence (LCS) of 2 sequences is a subsequence, with maximal length, which is common to both the sequences. Given two sequence, find any one longest common subsequence. In case multiple solutions exist, print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one non-empty common subsequence will exist.

3) You’re a spunky new programmer on the Microsoft Office team. They’ve hired you to work on a version of Word that works on the command line. Your boss needs you to write a program that takes in a paragraph of text and left-justifies it, so that each line contains at most a certain number of characters. Words shouldn’t be hyphenated across lines. Input Format :
Two numbers representing the maximum number of characters allowed in the screen (screen width), followed by that many words.
Output Format: The same words, with endlines such that no line has a number of characters (including spaces) exceeding the maximum width.
